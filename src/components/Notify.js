      <Alert.Heading>Hey, nice to see you</Alert.Heading>
      <p>
        Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This
        example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how
        spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
      </p>
    </Alert>
